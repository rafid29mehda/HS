It's common for students to apply for graduate programs while they are still completing their undergraduate degrees. Universities in the USA understand this and allow applicants to submit their applications before officially graduating. Here's how you can handle this situation:

### 1. **Submitting Your Bachelor's Transcript:**
   Since you are still in your final year, you will submit what is called an **"in-progress transcript"** or **"unofficial transcript"** at the time of application. This transcript includes all the courses and grades you have completed up to the point of your application.

   **Explanation:**
   - The university understands that you haven't finished all your courses yet. They will evaluate your application based on your academic performance so far (up to the **4.1** semester in your case).
   - Most universities will require you to submit your **final transcript** after you graduate (after completing your **4.2 semester**) if you are admitted.

   **Example:**
   If you apply in **October 2025** for Spring 2026, you will submit your transcript showing your grades from **1st year to 4.1 semester**. After you complete your **4.2 semester** (probably in **early 2026**), you'll then provide the official **final transcript** when you are ready to join the program.

### 2. **Degree Certificate (Provisional Degree):**
   Since you won’t have your final bachelor's degree at the time of application, you’ll need to provide an **expected graduation letter** or an **enrollment verification** from your university.

   **Explanation:**
   - Most universities allow applicants to submit a **provisional degree certificate** or **graduation confirmation** letter from their current university, which verifies that you are expected to complete your degree by a specific date.
   - Once you graduate, you’ll provide the official degree certificate.

   **Example:** You can ask your university to issue a letter stating, "This is to confirm that [Your Name] is a current student in the final year of the Bachelor’s program in Computer Science and Engineering and is expected to graduate by [Month, Year]."

### What Happens After You Apply:
- **Conditional Admission:** Many universities will give you a **conditional offer of admission** based on your current grades and the expectation that you will complete your degree on time. Once you graduate and submit your final transcript and degree, the conditional offer will be updated to a **full admission**.
  
- **Timeline:** If you complete your **4.2 semester** in 2025 and officially graduate in late 2025 or early 2026, you will submit your **final transcript** and **degree certificate** to the university before enrolling in Spring 2026.

### Key Points to Remember:
1. **In-progress Transcript**: Submit the most updated version of your transcript, which will likely be up to the 4.1 semester.
   
2. **Expected Graduation Letter**: Request a letter from your university confirming that you will complete your degree by a certain date (probably December 2025 or early 2026).

3. **Final Transcript & Degree**: After completing your 4.2 semester and officially graduating, you’ll need to submit the final version to the university.

**Next Steps:**
- Start preparing your transcript and plan when to request the graduation letter from your university.
- Check the specific instructions on each university's website. Some universities may have special forms for "expected graduation" or "provisional degree" requirements, and their deadlines for submitting the final documents vary.
