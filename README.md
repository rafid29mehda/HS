I plan to start my studies in the U.S. from **January 2026**, here's a detailed guide on how to approach the process, including when to contact professors, and how to improve your chances of getting funding.

### 1. **Timeline for Contacting Professors and Preparing Applications**

- **Start Contacting Professors**: 
  Ideally, begin contacting professors **9-12 months** before your intended start date, which would be **January 2025 to April 2025** for a January 2026 start. This is because most professors finalize their funding decisions months in advance, and universities have set application deadlines.

- **University Deadlines**: For spring intakes (January), many universities have application deadlines around **August to October** of the previous year. Therefore, you should start researching programs and professors early in **2025**.

- **Suggested Timeline**:
  - **January 2025**: Research universities, identify professors working in cloud computing, and prepare for exams like GRE or TOEFL (if required).
  - **April - June 2025**: Begin emailing professors to introduce yourself, express interest in their research, and inquire about potential openings for PhD/master’s students in January 2026.
  - **August - October 2025**: Submit your applications to universities, including your statement of purpose (SOP), letters of recommendation, and academic transcripts.
  - **November - December 2025**: Follow up with professors and wait for admission offers. Ensure your visa and funding arrangements are in place.

### 2. **How to Reach Out to Professors for Funding**

To maximize your chances of securing funding (scholarships, research assistantships, or teaching assistantships), your emails to professors need to be well-crafted. Here's how to structure your outreach:

- **Subject Line**: Keep it concise yet informative. E.g., "Prospective PhD Applicant – Cloud Computing Research & Funding Inquiry"

- **Introduction**: Briefly introduce yourself, mention your relevant achievements (such as the **Microsoft AZ-104 certification** and leadership in the **Robotics Club**), and express your interest in the professor's research.

- **Research Alignment**: Highlight how your research interests align with the professor’s current projects. For example, if the professor works on cloud-based systems, mention how your experience with Azure could contribute to their work.

- **Inquiry about Funding**: Politely inquire about the possibility of joining their lab with funding. You can say something like, *"I would like to inquire if there are opportunities for research assistantships or other funding options available for the Spring 2026 intake."*

- **Attachments**: Include your CV and academic transcripts to give them a clear idea of your qualifications.

### 3. **Improving Your Profile for PhD/Master's Admissions**

Given that you have one year left, here are the key ways you can further improve your chances of securing admission and funding:

#### 3.1. **Research Experience**  
Try to get involved in cloud computing-related research projects at your current university. Research experience, especially if it leads to publications, can significantly strengthen your application. If cloud computing projects aren’t available, try to work on independent projects, possibly contributing to open-source projects.

#### 3.2. **Publications**  
If possible, aim to publish a research paper, even if it's in a smaller conference or journal. Publications demonstrate your ability to conduct research, which is a crucial component of PhD applications.

#### 3.3. **Additional Certifications**  
Your **AZ-104 Azure Administrator Certification** is a strong point. Adding more certifications, such as **AZ-305 (Azure Solutions Architect)** or certifications in **AWS Cloud** or **Google Cloud**, will further enhance your profile.

#### 3.4. **Strong Statement of Purpose (SOP)**  
Write a compelling SOP that outlines your background, research interests, and why you’re interested in cloud computing. Clearly state your need for funding, and how your work aligns with the professor’s projects.

#### 3.5. **Good Test Scores (GRE, TOEFL/IELTS)**  
Some U.S. universities may still require **GRE** scores. While the GRE is being waived by many schools, a strong score (especially in the Quantitative section) will add to your competitiveness. For TOEFL or IELTS, aim for scores that are above the minimum requirements (TOEFL >100, IELTS >7.0).

#### 3.6. **Networking**  
Attend cloud computing conferences, workshops, and webinars, even if virtual. This can help you build relationships with faculty members, which may be useful when reaching out to professors for PhD supervision.

### 4. **Funding Opportunities**

Here are the primary ways you can secure funding for your studies in the U.S.:

#### 4.1. **Research Assistantships (RA)**
Professors offer RA positions funded by their research grants. These typically cover tuition and provide a stipend. To secure an RA, your research interests should align with the professor’s ongoing projects. This is why it's crucial to communicate effectively in your emails about your relevant skills and background.

#### 4.2. **Teaching Assistantships (TA)**
TAs help professors with grading, tutoring, or teaching undergraduate students. If you have strong academic performance or prior teaching experience (e.g., as president of the Robotics Club), this could be a good funding option.

#### 4.3. **University Fellowships**
Many universities offer merit-based fellowships to high-achieving students, which can cover tuition and living expenses. Some universities automatically consider you for these fellowships when you apply, but others may require a separate application.

#### 4.4. **External Scholarships**
Explore scholarships specifically for international students, such as:
  - **Fulbright Foreign Student Program**: Highly competitive, covers full expenses.
  - **AAUW International Fellowships** (for women).
  - **Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program**.

#### 4.5. **Government and Industry Fellowships**
Look into fellowships provided by the U.S. government or tech companies that focus on cloud computing research. For example, companies like **Microsoft**, **Google**, and **Amazon** offer fellowships or grants to students working on cutting-edge cloud technologies.

### 5. **Application Requirements to Study in the U.S.**

- **Academic Records**: Strong GPA (above 3.0, preferably closer to 3.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale).
- **Letters of Recommendation**: At least 2-3 strong letters, preferably from professors or mentors who know your research potential.
- **GRE**: If required by the university (not all require it post-pandemic).
- **TOEFL/IELTS**: If English is not your first language, you'll need these scores to prove proficiency.
- **Statement of Purpose (SOP)**: A compelling essay outlining your research interests and why you want to pursue graduate studies in cloud computing.

### Conclusion

To sum up, I should:
1. Start contacting professors by **January 2025** for a January 2026 start.
2. Strengthen your profile by gaining more research experience, pursuing publications, and enhancing your technical certifications.
3. Secure funding through research assistantships, teaching assistantships, or external scholarships.

Prepare a strong, tailored application, and start networking with professors well before application deadlines. With your background and strategic preparation, you have a solid chance of securing both admission and funding for your master's or PhD in the U.S.
