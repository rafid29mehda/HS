Having a one-year gap in your academic timeline is not uncommon, and it generally should not negatively impact your PhD application as long as you explain it well. Universities are usually understanding about such gaps, especially if you can show that you used the time productively or if there were valid reasons for it.

### How to Handle the One-Year Gap in Your Application:

1. **Mention it in Your Statement of Purpose (SOP) or Application:**
   - You should briefly explain the gap in your **Statement of Purpose (SOP)** or wherever the application asks for additional information. You don’t need to provide a lengthy explanation—just be honest and concise.
   
   **Example:**  
   If you took the gap for personal reasons, health issues, internships, research, or work, mention it briefly and explain how it helped you grow or prepare for your future studies.

   **Example Statement:**  
   "During the period between my 3rd and 4th year of undergraduate studies, I took a one-year gap to focus on [reason for the gap, e.g., personal development, family reasons, internships, work experience]. This time allowed me to gain practical experience in [specific area related to your field], which enhanced my skills and gave me a deeper understanding of [research interest, technical skills, etc.]."

2. **No Gaps in Transcripts:**
   - Since you have transcripts for all completed semesters from **1.1 to 3.2**, there won’t be any gaps in the official academic record. Universities will see your completed semesters and that you are now continuing with **4.1** and **4.2**.
   - The important thing is that you are completing your degree and that the gap hasn’t prevented you from staying on track academically.

3. **Use the Gap Year to Your Advantage (if possible):**
   - If you spent your gap year doing something related to your field, such as internships, online courses, research, or even personal projects, mention this in your CV and SOP. It shows that you stayed productive and kept learning even when you weren’t formally enrolled.
   
   **Example:**  
   "During my gap year, I worked as an intern at [Company Name] where I developed [skills/experience]. This hands-on experience helped me understand practical applications of [specific field in CSE] and further fueled my interest in pursuing research in [your PhD focus area]."

   Even if you didn't work or study during the gap, you can frame the time positively by talking about personal growth, reflection on your career goals, or overcoming challenges.

4. **Academic Progress Matters Most:**
   - PhD admissions committees primarily focus on your academic potential, research interests, and ability to contribute to the program. As long as you have strong transcripts from **1.1 to 3.2** and continue to perform well in **4.1** and **4.2**, the one-year gap is unlikely to be a major concern.

5. **Address the Gap in the Interview (if necessary):**
   - Some programs might invite you for an interview as part of the admissions process. If the gap comes up, just be ready to explain it confidently and positively, focusing on how you used the time or how you grew from the experience.

### Important Points:
- **Gaps are not a dealbreaker**: Many students have gaps due to various reasons (health, personal, work, etc.), and as long as you can provide a brief explanation, it shouldn't negatively affect your application.
  
- **Focus on your strengths**: Emphasize your academic achievements, research experience, and future goals in the application.

- **Maintain good grades**: Strong grades and research potential matter more than a gap year in most cases.

So, in summary, as long as you have a reasonable explanation and focus on your overall academic and research strengths, the one-year gap should not significantly affect your chances of being accepted into a PhD program in the USA. Let me know if you'd like help drafting your explanation or if you need advice on another aspect of your application!
